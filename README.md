# Description

This program is designed for an admin user with specific admin id and password to create a check-in object.
When a new check-in object is created, the server saves the object on database(mongoDB) and he/she will be redirected to a page 
that shows lists of people who checked into the check-in object.

On login.html, when a user clicks "CHECK_IN_NOW" link, the user will be asked to enter check-in id along with name and id.

* There's no error handling for this application
* mLab was used to test database operations
